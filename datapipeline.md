# Data pipeline

* Code for interfacing with pipeline being written by Ian Hinder. He is currently on holiday so I haven't been able to get the latest information on data pipeline.

* C++ code which either reads files locally or through the pipeline (by means of python). As far as I know reading is possible, but an implementation of writing files to the pipeline is not yet finished.

* Richard Bailey is the data broker for BEEPmbp model. As of the end of July he has placed some data files into the data pipeline. At that point he found the procedure rather difficult. He thought it would be better to have some way to automate the whole thing in R.  

* BEEPmbp currently uses the following datasets:

* Hospitalisations per day on a national level
* Hospital occupancy per week on a healthboard level
* Hospilatised deaths per week on a national level
* Community deaths per week on a national level
* Total deaths per week on a healthboard level

* Matrix of MSOA interactions gained from census flow data (Stephen Caterall)

* Age mixing matrices from Prem et al. paper

* Unofficial priors for latent and infectious periods and asymptomatic fraction.
