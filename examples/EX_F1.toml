description = "Objective: Assuming data up to some point in time, here we want to predict what is going to happen next.  Implementation: First inference is performed on the data, e.g. in 'map' mode, which generates posterior samples  (for both model parameters θ and state ξ) in the “Posterior/samples/” directory. Note, the time window for this inference is defined by ‘start’ and ‘end’ in the TOML file. Next using these posterior samples we simulate the model  forward in time beyond ‘end’ using the 'prediction' mode. ‘prediction-end = '100'’ sets the time to simulate until. Opening “visBEEP.html” and going to the “Prediction→State Output” tab on the menu we see the inherent variation in the number of weekly cases. Here the usual posterior distribution for states is showed until the ‘end’ time. Here we see a vertical dashed line with “Prediction start” beyond which are the future predictions from the model.  Model: An SEIR model with constant reproduction number R_t (i.e. the contact rate between individuals remains the same over time), as well as a constant external force of infection.  Data: Weekly number of E→I cases and measurements on the total infected I and recovered R populations.  Prediction: Simulates system dynamics beyond available dataset."
