description = "Objective: This example looks at a situation in which not all cases are observed. Specifically only a fraction 0.5 are assumed to be observed (this is somewhat akin to a sensitivity of a test).  Implementation: In ‘data-tables‘ the ‘factor’ property is set to “0.5”.  Model: An SEIR model with constant reproduction number R_t (i.e. the contact rate between individuals remains the same over time), as well as a constant external force of infection.  Data: Weekly number of E→I cases and measurements on the total infected I and recovered R populations.  Inference: The reproduction number R_t and latent and infectious periods."
