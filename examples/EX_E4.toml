description = "Objective: This example looks at incorporating a factor (m_t in Eq.(8)) which affects the relative mixing between and within areas (specificially, mt = 0 corresponds to no mixing between areas and m_t = 1 corresponds to mixing as specified by ‘geo-mixing-matrix’). In this example m_t is approximated by a temporal curve (specified by the user, e.g. making use of transport data) multiplied by a factor which is estimated.  Implementation: ‘geo-mixing-modify’ sets the spline giving m_t. Spatial results are plotted on a map of Scotland using boundary data specified in ‘area-plot’ (this sort of boundary data can often be found for geographical and administrative boundaries).  Model: An SIRD branching model with the population stratified into 32 Scottish local authorities. A contact matrix is specified which gives the rate of effective contact between individuals within and between different groups (note, this matrix only needs to be specified up to a constant factor). In this case the matrix is estimated from census commuter data. The infected individuals can either recover or die, with associated branching probabilities. The reproduction number R_t remains constant (i.e. the contact rate between individuals remains the same over time), as well as a constant external force of infection.  Data: Weekly number of S→I cases and I→D deaths, separately for the different areas.  Inference: The constant multiplying factor used to generate the area mixing factor m_t, the reproduction number R_t, branching probabilities and infectious period."
