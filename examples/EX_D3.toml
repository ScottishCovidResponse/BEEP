description = "Objective: The transmission rate in each area is assumed to be modified by a factor which gives the effect of a certain level applied to that area (where the level may change over time and is specified by the user), e.g. to mimic the effect of different levels of lock-down restrictions.  Implementation: ‘level-effect’ is used to define time-varying level effects.  Model: An SIRD branching model in which infected individuals can either recover or die, with associated branching probabilities. The base reproduction number R_t is taken to be constant but it is modified to vary by a factor for each level. A constant external force of infection is assumed.  Data: Weekly number of S→I cases and I→D deaths.  Inference: The level effects, reproduction number R_t, infectious period and branching probabilities."
