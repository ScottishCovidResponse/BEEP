# Contributing to BEEP

At present, contributions are limited to members of Scottish COVID-19
Response Consortium (SCRC).  If you are a member, please read the
below on how best to make progress on this project.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Please branch from the dev branch within
   ScottishCovidResponse/BEEP

-   Please **don't** fork this repository to your own
     github.com/username or other organisation.

2.  Read the issues and choose/be assigned an appropriate issue. This
   is likely to be either a `Starter issue` or one assigned by
   chatting in `zulip/BEEP`. You could also create an issue if
   there is something you want to work on that has not been mentioned.

3.  Name the branch `username/featurename`

4.  If referencing the issue from within a commit message then it
   should have the correct path to the issue on the
   `ScottishCovidResponse/SCRCIssueTracking` repository. An autolink
   reference has been created to make a shortcut;
   `ScottishCovidResponse/SCRCIssueTracking#123` -> `SCRC-123`. Please
   put the reference in the commit description (not the first line of
   the commit) i.e.:

-   `git commit -m "pithy description" -m "SCRC-123 and more details"` to refer to issue number 123. 

-   writing the commit message and description in an editor is also
      possible with `export EDITOR=vi` for example, and then just
      doing a `git commit`.

5.  Please run the tests (see [README.md](README.md)) before pushing.

6.  When your feature is ready to merge into the `dev` branch
   create a pull request against `ScottishCovidResponse/BEEP#dev`
   and assign `ScottishCovidResponse/BEEP` as reviewers.

7.  Semver will be handled in PRs from `dev` into `master`.

8.  Thanks for your time and effort!
